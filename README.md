Power BI Project â€“ Credit Card Transaction Dashboard

Designed and developed an interactive Credit Card Transaction Report in Power BI with three key modules: Transaction Report, Customer Report, and Overview Report.

Built KPIs to track Revenue (57M), Interest Earned (8M), Transaction Amount (46M), Total Transactions (5K+), and Customer Satisfaction (32K+), enabling quick insights into business performance.

Created dynamic visualizations including:

Revenue analysis by Expense Type, Customer Job, and Education Level.

Customer segmentation by Card Category, Job, Education Level, and Income Bracket.

Time-based insights by Quarter, Month, and Week using slicers and filters.

Incorporated advanced comparative analysis such as:

Revenue vs. Transaction trends with WoW and YTD analysis.

Gender-based revenue contribution (Male 31M vs. Female 26M).

Card performance analysis, showing Blue & Silver cards contribute to 93% of overall transactions.

Added delinquency and activation insights, including overall activation rate (57.5%) and delinquent rate (6.06%), supporting risk management.

Implemented an intuitive UI/UX with buttons for report navigation, slicers for filtering (gender, quarter, age group, state, expense type), and well-structured layouts for executive-level decision-making.

Enabled stakeholders to monitor KPIs, customer behavior, and financial health of credit card business in real time, driving data-driven decisions.
